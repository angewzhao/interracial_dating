## Introduction

This is partial reproduction of the 2011 How Americans (mostly donâ€™t)
Find an Interracial Partner by Reuben J. Thomas using the How Couples
Meet and Stay Together 2009 dataset.

This project looks at all the ways interracial couples meet and the
demographics of interracial couples themselves: how they met, their age,
their race, and their sexual orientation.

Looking at how people find partners is an important study into the
propagation of cultural and social norms that may deeply encode certain
inequalities and segregation through the creation of a family unit.
Conclusions pulled from this dataset may create deeper insights into how
race and gender boundaries are bridged.

Although Hispanic is an ethnicity, it will be treated as a race due to
the increasingly large number of people identifying as only Hispanic and
no other race on the US census.

## Conclusion:

The general takeaways would be that same-race trends do not predict
interracial couples. In fact, they are sometimes so different as to
inquire to the social norms defining the such interactions.

More research should be looked into to find what defines the different
social interactions and circles.

## Data wrangling

``` r

    !is.na(partner_race)
  ) %>% 
  select(
    respondent_race,
    partner_race,
    weight2, 
  ) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(respondent_race, partner_race), recode, !!! recode_race) %>% 
  mutate(
    distinct_pair = 
      str_c(
        pmin(as.character(respondent_race), as.character(partner_race)), 
        "-", 
        pmax(as.character(respondent_race), as.character(partner_race))
      )
  ) %>% 
  count(distinct_pair, wt = weight2) %>%

\#\# Same sex vs Different Sex Distributions

When looking at the distributions of interracial pairings within same
sex and different sex couples, it seems that same sex couples tend to
have higher proportions of interracial dating than different sex
couples.

``` r

  drop_na(interracial) %>% 
  count(same_sex_couple, interracial, wt = weight2) %>%
  group_by(same_sex_couple) %>%

    x = "Same or Different Sex Couples",

## Basic Demographics of Couples - Age and US raised

General takeaway: Trends in same race do not predict to interracial
pairings. This suggests the presence of separate dating pools for
interracial and same race couples.

### Age diff of couples

  data_meet_basics %>%

        r_gender == "M" ~ r_age - p_age, 
        p_gender == "M" ~ p_age - r_age, 
        TRUE ~ r_age - p_age
      ), 
  ) %>% 
  group_by({{var}}) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_age_diff = weighted.mean(age_diff, wt = weight2, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot( 
    aes(
      fct_reorder({{var}}, mean_age_diff), 
      mean_age_diff
    )
  ) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = weighted.mean(mean_age_diff, wt = n))) +

\#\#\# Meeting places, by same-race and different-race pairings

General takeaway: gender affects meeting places as much as race.
Suggestion of different social norms and friend groups.

#### Function

``` r
couples_meet <- function(var, ...) {
  data_meet_ways %>% 
  filter(...) %>% 
  count(type_of_meeting, {{var}}) %>% 
  group_by({{var}}) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = n / sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder({{var}}, prop), prop)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = type_of_meeting, color = type_of_meeting)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = type_of_meeting)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -45, hjust = 0))
}
```

### Meeting places for all interracial couples
