This is partial reproduction of the 2011 How Americans (mostly don't) Find an Interracial Partner by Reuben J. Thomas using the How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2009 dataset. 

This project looks at all the ways interracial couples meet and the demographics of interracial couples themselves: how they met, their age, their race, and their sexual orientation. 

Looking at how people find partners is an important study into the propagation of cultural and social norms that may deeply encode certain inequalities and segregation through the creation of a family unit. Conclusions pulled from this dataset may create deeper insights into how race and gender boundaries are bridged. 

Although Hispanic is an ethnicity, it will be treated as a race due to the increasingly large number of people identifying as only Hispanic and no other race on the US census. 

## Conclusion:
The general takeaways would be that same-race trends do not predict interracial couples. In fact, they are sometimes so different as to inquire to the social norms defining the such interactions. 

More research should be looked into to find what defines the different social interactions and circles.
